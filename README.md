Installation Instructions
---
Download the exe and jar file -  select the desired options, and create a password. (If updates are enabled you could also just download the exe).

Select the components that you would like to enable - currently KuCoin and the Ergo Network are supported.

On first run of the Ergo Network you will be prompted to select the features which you would like to enable or click all, and then ok.

You may then create / open / restore a wallet using ergo wallets. Wallet files are cross compatible with Satergo. 

Sending funds with Ergo Wallets will require Ergo Nodes to be enabled. You may choose to install a local node or select a currently installed node.  If you are looking to select a current directory, ensure that you delete the "Local Node" name in the "Folder" field.   

Instead of installing or using a local node a default Public node is provided. You may also choose to add a different remote node.
