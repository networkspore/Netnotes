White Paper

"From the point of view of an application, the most ideal solution is to not rely on variables which are outside of the applications scope of control."
(https://github.com/networkspore/Netnotes/blob/main/Netnotes%20-%20ergohack%20VI.pdf)



The art of the interval, rather than the art of the connection, 
is not only medieval but Oriental; 
above all, it is the art mode of instant electric culture.
